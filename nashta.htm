<p class="pagecaption">Ashtanna</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ashtanna is the engineering assistant on the <a href="../items/antigone.htm">Antigoni</a>. She is very capable with the Magic aspects of things, but very weak in the Tech side. Her ability to intuit the Magic is almost as great as Anta's because of her spiritual connections. She worships the ground the twins walk on because of their incredible skills.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is the latest addition to the crew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ashtanna was abused by her parents and the Temple once they discovered she was a lesbian. The Temple tried to cure her at the request of her parents. This was done using psychological and physical torments, intended to reveal the wrongness of her beliefs. Ashtanna hates the Temple and has disavowed her parents. She never wears anything that will reveal her back or shoulders because they would show the scars from the tortures used by the Temple.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She dares not go city-side in places that are dominated by Templars because of how she left her home city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is spiritual, in her own way. She believes the life forms of Hexiaz are connected in a web of thought and energy that creates a 'god' that lives in the clouds. She is happiest when the ship is out in the clouds, away from the chaos and noise of the Hexiazi.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Personal Story Snippets</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She first felt the presence during one of her 'conversion' sessions at the temple. Her parents had discovered her with her friend, Marsa, in the throws of passion a year ago. They had thrown the other girl out of their house and called the temple on her. Immediately after, they had marched Ashtanna to the temple and demanded that the priesthood fix her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They had started slowly, praying over her, invoking the power of god to drive the wickedness from her. She had tried to pretend it was working, but she was not careful enough eight months later and she was seen with another woman. That's when the more direct 'conversion' treatments started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The vision came during one of her sessions under the lash. She was strapped naked across a table, bent at the waist, while two templars whipped her back with heavy leather braids with small metal pieces woven in. The blood was flowing freely, she could feel it dripping down her sides and buttocks from the gashes across her back. Her mind drifted, trying to escape the pain, when a warm awareness drifted in. It cocooned her, easing her mind away from the pain of her body. She barely felt the third priest penetrate her. It was a standard part of the 'therapy', getting her used to men and intended to convince her she loved the feel of male members thrusting into her. It had only increased her general hatred of men.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The presence drew her mind into the clouds and down toward the floor. She could see the vague shapes of the native life drifting in the clouds, engaged in their little understood dance of survival. She felt the tearing as a Hexiazi airship netted the small organisms used to produce the magic enhancement potions. She could feel the collective horror that the presence felt, and the slowly building anger in the life around her. She shuddered in fear, but the warmth returned, radiating calm and something like love. There was also a faint tendril of warmth that radiated down to her abused woman parts, soothing the pain of the intrusion and shifting something else, deep inside her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A small part of her heard a voice say, "We have been using this vessel for months now, why has it not become impregnated? The joys of motherhood would help its healing and supplant the unnatural desires."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It might be your seed, brother. We can add our contributions as well, before we end this session."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The presence enfolded her again, taking her away from the brutality her body was suffering. It kept her drifting as the templars rubbed salt into the wounds on her back, before bandaging them just enough to keep the blood from showing through her loose dress. As they raised her from the table, their fluids spilled down her legs. One used a stream of cold water to rinse away the worst of it, then they threw a plain dress at her. "Dress yourself, disgraceful thing. Your perverted body is an abomination in the sight of god."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aren't you going to ask if I have repented?" she asked in a voice that was steadier and stronger than her regular voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They looked at her sharply as the leader said, "You haven't before when we asked you. Have you now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So you have given up, even as you continue the abuse? You must be truly sadistic, useless bits of skin after all. Will you ever be castigated for your failures, or are your leaders as idiotic as you? Do you really believe this kind of thing works?" Part of her mind felt distant, wthdrawn from the exchange, watching it as if through lenses or displays.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Provoke us at your peril, abomination," growled the leader.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her vision blurred, then blacked out. She felt herself move rapidly in motions that didn't completely register. This went on for what felt like several minutes, but might have been much less.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When her vision cleared and the room faded back into view, the priests were dead. The leader was draped over the table, naked, hands tied to the restraints. His second was naked and slumped over him, his member lodged up the ass of his boss. The third one was tied to the front of the table, his member shoved in the mouth of the leader.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her vision faded again and shifted to a view of swirling clouds and drifting creatures. She hung there in the clouds as time seemed to pass. When her vision cleared again, she was striding down a passage near the docks, dressed as a Templar Inquisitor. Her steps took her to a small shop filled with airship crew gear. She purchased a set of crew gear and presented the Templar credit structic as she left. The clerk looked at her, visibly shuddered, and waved her payment away. "Take it, lady, please. We want no trouble with the Temples."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sheblacked out again and returned to find herself on a ship, seated in front of a square faced woman with heavy blond braids and two dreadlocked redheads who had to be twins. The blond woman was saying, "Welcome aboard, Ashtanna. The twins have given their approval for you to join the crew as the engineering assistant. I was surprised at your application. Someone of your skills could make far better pay with one of the larger ships."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Information slowly drifted into her awareness, showing she had petitioned for the position and had passed a set of carefully constructed tests to verify ability. The blond was Captain J'Anya of the Antigoni. The redheads were Emly and Anta, the engineers for the ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just as Ashtanna was about to speak, a man strode in and whispered something in J'Anya's ear. "Excuse me a moment," she said as she rose and left the mess hall. Outside, M'Ardett, the one who had interrupted, led her to the bridge and the open news feed from the city. On it was the face of Ashtanna and a voice saying, "...wanted in connection with the brutal torture and murder of several Temple priests. Consider this woman a clear and present danger to any she may encounter. Do not approach. Contact the Temple immediately." The buletin repeated as J'Anya said, "I like her better already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Captain! Why must you fly in the face of the Temple? Every time you do this, we suffer with worse conditions, higher expenses, and poorer cargo."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As I've said before, I wouldn't have an issue if they weren't forcing their views on the rest of us. Believe whatever you need to get through your life, but just because it works for you, doesn't mean it works for someone else."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">J'Anya turned and made her way back to the mess hall. "You've made the city warning feed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ashtanna rose, "Will you let me leave or hold me for the Templars?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You may leave, or you could accept the position you applied for."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'd hire a fugitive?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not any fugitive, but someone who blackened the eye of the Temple is always welcome here. I hate them, maybe as much as you must, but I haven't been quite so direct with it. I admire the spirit, even as I say it was less than advised. Please try to be a bit more subtle while you're on the crew."</p>
