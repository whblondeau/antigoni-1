## The planets, from the Sun outward:

 - Sargual, a small airless tidelocked rock, very hot on the dayside, very cold on the darkside. Some mining domes <97> rare metals supported the effort of establishing twilight band settlements.

 - Issfr, another tidelocked world, but bigger and with a substantial (but not breathable) atmosphere. Civilization is still mostly limited to the twilight zone. Issfr's orbit is only slightly outside that of Sargual.

 - The Hot Belt, innermost of the System's two asteroid belts.

 - Gauz, a watery hot planet whose moon Kuros is so large that the planet is sometimes called "Gauz-Kuros".

 - Torestre, the Earthlike planet on which humankind evolved. Two moons, Coin and Bead.

 - Hexiaz, a world similar to Torestre in size, with an extremely deep atmosphere and a native ecology.

 - The Cold Belt, much larger and colder than the insystem Hot Belt. Includes a lot of ice-rich bodies, and is in fact the primary source of water and other light fluids for outer-system operations. Hexiaz is thought to have been heavily bombarded by elements of the Cold Belt. Some planetologists argue that Hexiaz is merely the largest remaining fragment of the initial planetary breakup that created the Cold Belt.

 - Yst, a small airless world, with "Airspaces", magically constrained bubbles of air, clinging to its black surface. Some of them are hundreds of miles across. Ystian Airspaces are the largest persistent magical structures known.

 - Dompar, a gas giant.
   
 - Reng, a very large gas giant with spectacular rings and its own moonlet belt.

 - Erriamm, a smaller ice giant, very far out.
